# Polling
Beaverean Polling

# How-To
Step One: Find the poll that you want.

Step Two: Write your answer in the text field.

Step Three: Press submit.

Step Four: Check for success. If it says submitted, great! If not, check the console (figure out how to get there on your browser) and send me the problem in this repo.

Thanks!

# The&nbsp;Request-Poll&nbsp;Button

This button is also still a work in progress.

It will open a modal.

The modal will have one button in it. When you click on it, it will open, in a new tab, a new email with some stuff already there. Simply add the poll name, notes, etc, where it says.

Remember, it is still a work in progress.

# Notes

We are planning on implementing a "create poll" feature. The best way for us will require a move of the website. We will link it here when/if it is made.

This website is still not perfect. 

Expect some bugs (though we will try to patch them quickly).

We may take down polls if they are inactive for too long

Finally, thanks so much!

# Opening

Simply open the <a href="https://beaver-kingdom.github.io/polling/">website</a> in the link!
