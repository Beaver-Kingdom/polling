# How-To-Use
Step One: Find the poll that you want (we may take down polls if they are inactive for too long).

Step Two: Write your answer in the text field.

Step Three: Press submit.

Step Four: Check for success. If it says submitted, great! If not, check the console (figure out how to get there on your browser) and send me the problem in this repo.

Thanks!


# Notes

We are planning on implementing a "create poll" feature. The best way for us will require a move of the website. We will link it here when/if it is made.

This website is still not perfect. Expect some bugs (though we will try to patch them quickly)

Finally, thanks so much!
